Project Title: NEWM-N315 Final Project

Project Description: This project is functional prototype of a single page application with authentication and data storage handled with Firebase and Firebase's Firestore product. Specifically, this is an application designed to give a user an account on a recipe repository. The user can create an account, sign in, and browse, create, edit, and view recipes to their specification.

Implementation: This application is implemented via Firebase and custom HTML, CSS, and ES6. Run this on a Node.JS server or a XAMPP installation will suffice. Most servers would support drop-in functionality of this source code.
